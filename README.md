# FunnelExtension

The goal of this Chrome Extension is to change the UI and UX of ClickFunnels.com.

It is a work in progress and mostly designed to create a Dark Mode. There is also many improvements to the editor and to the UI where I have left notes for the user on certain pages to provide more help. Basically as an avid user of ClickFunnels I wanted to make my own changes to the website. You can now use those features aswell. If you would like to provide feedback please submit an issue! I'd love to hear from you.

Soon to be on Google Chrome Store.
